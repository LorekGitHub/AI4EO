# ♻️ Environmental Impact of This Project

Experiments were conducted using Google Cloud (Colab backend) in region `europe-west1`, which has a carbon efficiency of **0.27 kgCO₂eq/kWh**.

- **Hardware**: NVIDIA T4 GPU (TDP 70W)
- **Compute time (of ML)**: ~ 2 hours through trial, (~ 15 mins on single run-through + ~ 10 for preprocess / shap values) [Repeat RAM crash requires repeat runs]
- **Estimated CO₂ emissions**: **0.05 kg CO₂eq**
- **(~ 0.03 kg of coal burned, 8.33 x10-4
Tree seedlings sequesting carbon for 10 years)** 
- **Offset**: 100% carbon offset by Google Cloud

> Calculated using the [ML CO₂ Impact calculator](https://mlco2.github.io/impact#compute)  
> Based on Lacoste et al., *Quantifying the Carbon Emissions of Machine Learning*, [arXiv:1910.09700](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.09700)
